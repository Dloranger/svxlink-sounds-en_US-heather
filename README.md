English Language Pack SvxLink Server
====================================
This is an english language pack for [SvxLink Server](http://www.svxlink.org/) created using the
Heather voice from the [Acapela Box](https://www.acapela-box.com/) service.

These are raw files which cannot be used directly with SvxLink Server. They must first be processed
using the filter_sounds.sh script to the correct format.

FIXME: More instructions should be written here...
